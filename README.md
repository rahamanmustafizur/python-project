Using the Quiz Application, it will be possible for special users, called administrators, to create tests, and then regular users can answer the questions and test their understanding.

This project consists of setting quizzes and asking people to answer them. Therefore, users should be able to ask questions, and other users should be able to answer them. The application will then display the final score and the correct answers.
Users should be able to create tests by uploading a text file with the questions and answers. You will be able to choose the format of the text file, so the application can convert the file into a quiz.
For this project, you will need to implement a database. Usersâ€™ questions, possible answers, correct answers, and scores will be stored in a database.
